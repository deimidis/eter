April 1, 2018

## Duration of the project in months
6 months

## Project Description
Air pollution -especially particulate matter- is an invisible killer affecting the health of 80% of urban population, being responsible not only for respiratory diseases, but also for strokes, heart disease and lung cancer1. In 2016, the World Health Organization tagged Buenos Aires2 as one of the risky cities over the 10 μg/m3 limit for particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers -PM2.5-. Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (AMBA) is daily affected by heavy traffic and industries, however, public data on air quality is inexistent.
Increased availability of low-cost reliable sensors combined with open source ethics foster opportunities for community-developed environmental monitoring devices3. Prototyping methodology helps empowering and developing tech skills in people, integrating different areas of knowledge into the building of an object4. Environmental monitoring allows us to engage a more diverse group of people that usually wouldn’t approach Hacklabs, but get enthusiastic when they learn about the potential and benefits of open source tools.
A few open source air quality monitors have been documented5. We’ll base our work on a local award-winning project6, outdated due to discontinued hardware components.

## Objectives & Activities

1. Disseminate open science among high school teachers so they can train their students
  
  a. Co-prototype with teachers an open source air quality monitor (PM10, PM2.5, temperature,
  humidity)
  
  b. Develop OER on why running open science school projects and how to do it

2. Generate decentralized open data on air quality of the AMBA

  a. Produce and install AQmonitors

  b Host data in our servers

3. Make project replicable
  
  a. Document the whole process thoroughly


## Outputs | Whom&Where | Outcomes

1a. Prototype & documentation | Selected teachers in AMBA;Hacklab | Increase teachers’ tech skills;
Community building

1b. Open science resources kit for high school teachers in Sp-En | LatAm teachers & schools | Reach wider
audience

2a. 5 operational AQmonitors | Hacklab & schools | Community empowerment

2b. Open data set | Government, community, NGOs, researchers (Global) | Public access to environmental
data

3a. Project Documentation in several formats, in open platform | Teachers, makers, researchers, Open
Hardware community-Global | Amplify project impact; reference for future bigger projects

**We expect to provide evidence of potential of open source+citizen science for community
empowerment & research in Latin America, as a test pilot for future bigger projects.**
