### :balloon: What are we doing?

#### The problem
Air pollution is an invisible threat, affecting the health of 80% of urban population[1](http://breathelife2030.org/). In 2016 the WHO determined Buenos Aires (Argentina) air quality exceeds the recommended standard of 10 μg/m3 for particulate matter (PM) that has a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers[2](http://gamapserver.who.int/gho/interactive_charts/phe/oap_exposure/atlas.html), highly detrimental to human health.

However, public air quality data of Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is inexistant. some companies offer the service of monitoring air quality, but is expensive and therefore inaccesible, and data is difficult to understand for most of the population.

#### What are we doing?
In ETER we pretend to build an open source device that measures air quality (PM2.5 and PM10), based on previous argentinean development [MACA Project](monitorabierto.wikidot.com). We're doing it together with high school teachers and community members working in Area Reconquista - José León Suárez, a highly socio-environmental conflicted area in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

Besides building the device, we're producing open educational resources to make it possible for anyone to replicate the experience. Data will be hosted in [R'lyeh hacklab](https://rlab.be) server, open access.

The third part of ETER project is the design of an online game, aimed to divulgate open resources that are useful for implementing community science projects.

We think people should be aware of the tools available that can help making their problems visible and searching for alternative local solutions. Combining low-cost sensors with free software ethics, we aim to show the potential of free/libre technologies for addressing community needs.

### :balloon: Who are we?
ETER was born from the interaction of different people gathered at [R'lyeh](https://wiki.rlab.be), a hacklab or horizontal community space in Buenos Aires city, where we work on technology with a free software perspective.

At the moment, collaborators are [Julieta](https://twitter.com/yelomba), [David](https://github.com/violenti), [Daniel](https://github.com/Danieldaza), [Marshmaline](https://github.com/Marshmaline), [Vladimir](https://github.com/vladimirAvilaProsser), [Zeta](https://github.com/z37a), [Nano](https://github.com/nanocastro), Patricia and [Juli](https://github.com/thessaly).

Juli is attending the [Mozilla Open Leaders Programme](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#cohort-d) with ETER project. [Universidad Nacional de San Martín](http://www.unsam.edu.ar/) and [Aerocene](http://aerocene.org/), an artists collective, are also part of ETER.

We applied to a [Mozilla Science](https://science.mozilla.org/) mini-grant for funding, and we got it! In case you're interested, [this](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/blob/master/financiamiento/letter_of_intent.md) is the Letter of Intent we wrote for Mozilla.

### :balloon: What do we need?
All collaborations are welcome :D

We need help in different areas: front-end development, back-end, IoT, education, game developing, design, translations... There's always something to do!

You can check our list of pending issues [here](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/issues)

### :balloon: How can I contribute?
If you want to contribute, please check our [guide for collaborators](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [project](../../issues/1), where we list all the tasks we're doing.

For us is important to keep a friendly and supportive environment within the project :) That's why we ask you to read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), that applies both to online and offline meetings.

### :balloon: Contact
If you have any question you can contact us via e-mail: <contacto@rlab.be> or you can open an issue in GitHub if you're familiar with the procedure.

### :question: Glossary
* **WHO**: World Health Organization
* **PM 2.5**: atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair!)
* **PM 10**: atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 10 micrometers
* **Free software**: software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis [From [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)]
* **Hacklab**: it's a space where you can hack, learn to hack, teach to hack, create, destroy, repair and develop things. Here we use the verb 'hack' in a wide sense, beyond software, to any area of interest.
* **README file**: a document presenting a project to the public and potential collaborators
* **repository** or **repo**: a collection of documents related to a project, where you can store both code or content
* **Issue**: it's the term GitHub uses for tasks and enhancements to be done in a project

# :sparkles: Thank you for visiting us!

ETER is a collaborative project, we are all doing it together. Thanks for reading! :star2: :sparkling_heart:
