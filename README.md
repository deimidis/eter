Air pollution is an invisible threat, affecting the health of 80% of urban population[1](http://breathelife2030.org/). However, public air quality data in places like Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area is inexistant. Monitoring is expensive and therefore inaccesible, and data is difficult to understand for most of the population.

We think people should be aware of the tools available that can help making their problems visible and searching for alternative local solutions. Combining low-cost sensors with free software ethics, we aim to show the potential of free/libre technologies for addressing community needs.

#### What are we doing?

1- We are building an open source device that measures air quality (PM2.5 and PM10) together with high school teachers and community members from Area Reconquista, Buenos Aires - Argentina [DEVICE REPO](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter-monitor)

2- We are documenting the process in an open educational resource [WORKSHOP REPO](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter-workshop)

3- We are developing an online game aimed to divulgate open resources that are useful for implementing community science projects [GAME REPO](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter-game)

### How can you contribute?
If you want to contribute, please check our [guide for collaborators](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

For us is important to keep a friendly and supportive environment within the project :) That's why we ask you to read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), that applies both to online and offline meetings.

### Who are we?
At the moment, collaborators are [Julieta](https://twitter.com/yelomba), [Leo](https://github.com/lmaddio), [Daniel](https://github.com/Danieldaza), [Marshmaline](https://github.com/Marshmaline), [Vladimir](https://github.com/vladimirAvilaProsser), [Zeta](https://github.com/z37a), [Nano](https://github.com/nanocastro), Patricia and [Juli](https://github.com/thessaly).

ETER was born at [R'lyeh](https://wiki.rlab.be). [Universidad Nacional de San Martín](http://www.unsam.edu.ar/) and [Aerocene](http://aerocene.org/), an artists collective, are also part of ETER.

We applied to a [Mozilla Science](https://science.mozilla.org/) mini-grant for funding, and we got it! In case you're interested, [this](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/blob/master/financiamiento/letter_of_intent.md) is the Letter of Intent we wrote for Mozilla. Juli is also attending the [Mozilla Open Leaders Programme](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#cohort-d) with ETER project. 

### Contact
If you have any question you can contact us via e-mail: <contacto@rlab.be> or you can open an issue in GitHub if you're familiar with the procedure.

#### :question: Glossary
* **WHO**: World Health Organization
* **PM 2.5**: atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers (which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair!)
* **PM 10**: atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 10 micrometers
* **Free software**: software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis [From [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)]
* **Hacklab**: it's a space where you can hack, learn to hack, teach to hack, create, destroy, repair and develop things. Here we use the verb 'hack' in a wide sense, beyond software, to any area of interest.
* **README file**: a document presenting a project to the public and potential collaborators
* **repository** or **repo**: a collection of documents related to a project, where you can store both code or content
* **Issue**: it's the term GitHub uses for tasks and enhancements to be done in a project
