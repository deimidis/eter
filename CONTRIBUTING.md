## Code of conduct

This project and all its members agree to follow the [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you want to collaborate, we'll also ask you to follow it.

You can report any unacceptable situationvia e-mail: [contacto@rlab.be](mailto:contacto@rlab.be).

## How can I contribute?

As a first step, you can check our [Roadmap](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/projects).

There you will find that ETER is organised in four sub-projects:

* [Device building](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/projects/4)
* [Game development](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/projects/3)
* [Community engagement](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/projects/2)
* [General & Documentation](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/projects/5)

Each sub-project contains tasks or *issues*, categorised in:

* To-do
* In-progress
* Done

### Beginner's taks

If this is your first time collaborating in a project, we suggest you find a concrete initial task to contribute with :wink:

You can look for the label *'good first issue'*. You can see all the issues labeled *'good first issue'* by clicking [here](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)


### Pending tasks

There are two ways of seeing all pending tasks:

* Entering the sub-project you're interested in and taking a look at the "To do" panel

* Checking the general list of [*issues*](https://github.com/rlyehlab/eter/issues), that only contains the "To Do" and "In progress" ones

There are lots of things to do, just choose one you like and leave a comment :smile:


### Suggesting enhancements

If you see anything that can be enhanced (text, code, translations, anything) just [create an *issue*](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) or if you're familiar with GitHub, create a pull request.


### I have a question

If you have any question, just let us know sending an email to [contacto@rlab.be](mailto:contacto@rlab.be).
